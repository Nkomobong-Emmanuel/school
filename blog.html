        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>We create a safe, stimulating educational environment, promoting the wonder and curiosity that motivates a student to learn in and beyond the classroom, and throughout life. We believe that achievement comes from sustained, purposeful effort and by learning to think critically, debate confidently, question assumptions and push limits.
            We believe language and culture shape and inform identity. We delight in difference, opening ourselves to authentic and meaningful interactions with cultures both in and outside school. We commit ourselves to grow and change individually and together, to ensure every learner’s identity, language, and values are respected.
            To lead as individuals and as members of their communities, future-ready young people must learn to thrive in an uncertain world, pairing deep self-knowledge and empathy with the skills to think analytically and constructively. We believe it is essential to develop the capacity to make decisions and take actions within an ethical framework, grounded in a spirited sense of hope in human potential.The mission at Headington International School is to develop courageous leaders who shape their world for the better.</p>

        <h3>Our Core Values</h3>
        <p>At our core is creating a joy of learning and purposeful effort, and mutual respect and understanding, in an inclusive and intercultural community.</p>

        <h3>What makes Headington International School so special?</h3>
        <p>The people.<br>
        Different by Design<br>
        Headington International School was founded in 1984 and opened its doors to students in 1985. The school was the vision of local families and leaders who wanted a different sort of private school in Atlanta.

        One where language learning would be centered - both as a skill and a key to cultural understanding. And one where difference and diversity would be embraced.

        These guiding principles are as relevant today as they were then, in our intentionally inclusive community. Collaborating across cultures and languages is just our way of life at H.I.S.</p>
